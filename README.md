# Processor in Verilog

This repository contains the design of a 32-bit mips based processor named as Jarvis. The processor was developed on the FPGA platform using the Verilog hardware description language. It is based on the unicycle processing principle and Harvard architecture.

In this project, the software Intel Quartus Prime Lite Edition Version 17.1 for Windows was used. You can download and install it from the following link:
